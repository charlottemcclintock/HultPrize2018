Data analysis of energy consumption, theft, and covariates for pitch at the Boston Regional Finals.

### Goal: 
Explore trends related to global electricity theft to better understand energy consumption and correlated variables to pitch a scalable, sustainable social enterprise to bring energy to 10 million people currently living in energy poverty.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We are interested in what variables affect and are correlated with electric power and distribution losses. The variables included in our analysis are electric power transmission and distribution losses (by % of output), access to electricity (% of population), total population, GDP (total US$), and development indicators in GDP per capita, and education of girls by % of female primary school age children out of school.
